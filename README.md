## About Me

I'm a 50+ single mom of 11-year-old twins, working on this project alongside my day job. I don't have an engineering or programming background - just a Master's in Public Administration and one in European Administrative Management.

**I'm proud of what I've built here.**

If someone with my background can create production-tested skills, hooks, and a GDPR-compliant B2B SaaS, so can you. AI-assisted development has opened doors that were closed to many of us before.
